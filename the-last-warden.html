            <h3>I. The First Canopy</h3>
            <p class="group-end">
                Before men shaped the world, the world shaped them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The forest was deep, its roots locked in silent embrace.
            </p>
            <p>
                Trees stood like pillars, their branches a vaulted sky of green and gold.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the quiet of dawn, mist drifted low over water that ran clean and pure
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                At dusk, the leaves caught the last light like embers, the air thick with pine.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not ruled, for it did not need to be.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                It needed no governance; even its imperfections belonged to a deeper harmony.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                It lasted, quietly defiant against time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Men lived beneath this canopy, not as masters, but as stewards.
            </p>
            <p>
                They lived and died beneath the trees; their blood fed its roots.
            </p>
            <p>
                Each man had his place, his burden, his portion of the whole.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The trees held them together—not by law, nor by force, but by the weight of natural order
            </p>
            <p>
                The roots bound the land as duty bound its people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their shade stretched wide as the bonds between kin.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their branches climbed toward heaven, as men once did.
            </p>
            <p>
                For as long as the trees stood, the land was strong.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                In the land's strength, men endured its weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                But strength does not lessen with time,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And in time, some began to ask:
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                <b>"Why must the trees stand so close? Why must we all shelter beneath the same shade?"</b>
            </p>
            <p>
                These were not the words of traitors, not of fools,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                but of men who have never known the cost of an open sky
            </p>
            <h3>II. The First Cut</h3>
            <p class="group-end">
                The trees had stood for so long that men no longer knew why they stood at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their fathers had built nothing new, for what else was needed?
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Their laws had not changed, for change had never been required.
            </p>
            <p>
                The trees sheltered them, held them, bound them together.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                But in time, men no longer saw them as shelter; they saw them as walls.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was not conquest that brought the first axe.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor treachery.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Nor even greed.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                It was restlessness.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                It was the hunger for something else, even if they did not know what.
            </p>
            <p>
                The man who struck the first blow did not seek to destroy.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                He only wished to see further.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The axe bit deep.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                A wound in its side, a silence in the forest.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Then, with a great groan, it <b>fell</b>.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The earth shuddered.
            </p>
            <p>
                Leaves burst into the air like startled birds.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The canopy split apart, and heaven rushed in—vast, brilliant, infinite.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the first time, the world was wide.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And in that widening, <b>something broke</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                The others stood at the edge of the clearing, staring into the open sky.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They had never seen the sun so bright, never felt the wind so unbound.
            </p>
            <p>
                But beneath their feet, the roots curled inward.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The soul, once held firm, loosened slightly.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And in the hush that followed, in the breath between what could have been and what would become—
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                There was a choice.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They could have stopped.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They could have let the silence settle, let the forest mend, let the wound heal.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                But who could deny the beauty of an open horizon?
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And so they cut another.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And another.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, the canopy thinned, and they rejoiced.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then the ground dried, but they scarcely noticed.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                For their eyes were fixed upward, their hearts captured by the promise of an open sky.
            </p>
            <h3>III. The Clearing</h3>
            <p>
                For a time, the clearing flourished.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                The sky, once hidden, opened wide.
            </p>
            <p>
                Towers rose where trees had stood, roads sprawled where roots had once held firm.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                No longer did all men walk the same path, no longer did they speak with a single tongue.
            </p>
            <p>
                The keepers were entrusted to guard memory and tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
                They opened their gates—
            </p>
            <p>
                First, to those who hungered for the fruit;
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, to those who promised growth from timber;
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And last, with weary resignation, to those who asked nothing yet took <b>everything</b>.
            </p>
            <p>
                At first, the keepers. still spoke reverently of the trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                They traced carefully where roots had run deep,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They marked faithfully where branches had sheltered generations.
            </p>
            <p>
                But memory is weaker than stone,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                and soon the clearing stretched further.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who had seen the trees grew old;
            </p>
            <p>
                Those who had not seen them grew numerous;
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Those who only knew only tales grew skeptical.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fruit was gathered, yet no seeds returned to earth.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wood was carried off, yet no groves arose in their place.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Land, once carefully tended, now lay starving
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                And then came the question, quiet yet piercing:
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                <strong><i>"If the trees were so strong, why did they fall?"</i></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The past grew faint as the sky loomed larger.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                History became memory, memory faded into myth, and myth dissolved into silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                And from that silence emerged men who waited,
            </p>
            <p>
                Shadow men who built nothing, sowed nothing—yet gathered everything.
            </p>
            <p>
                They did not speak loudly, for they did not need to.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They knew precisely what to do with a land that had forgotten itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                The keepers spoke no more of trees.
            </p>
            <p>
                They recited the old ways, but only as fables.
            </p>
            <p>
                They gathered in councils, but only to postpone decision.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They invoked unity, but only fueled dissent
            </p>
            <p>
                And at last, turning desperately to one another, searching for something still shared—
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                <b>They found only dust</b>.
            </p>
            <h3>IV. A Quiet Exchange</h3>
            <p>
                The shadow men had always been there.
            </p>
            <p>
                They did not build.
            </p>
            <p>
                They did not sow.
            </p>
            <p>
                Their faith was emptiness, their sacrament subtlety.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Decay rewards those who outlast purpose.

            <p>
                They carried no banners, raised no armies,

            <p>
                they came softly—as merchants, as scribes,

                In the emptiness, they whispered softly, as always:

                Soon, whispers became invitations, open and warm.

                The wardens—sworn guardians of fading meaning—
            </p>
            <p>
                Welcomed them, mistaking quiet confidence for wisdom,

                Commerce for renewal.

            <p>
                Piece by piece, the world was sold.

            <p>
                Not by conquest, but gently—by compromise,

            <p class="group-end">
                By hands that forgot how to hold loss.

            <p>
                the wardens pleaded for answers,

            <h3>V. The Last Tower</h3>
            <p>
                The wardens guarded only what remained when meaning fled:
            </p>
            <p>
                Laws without spirit,
            </p>
            <p>
                walls without roots,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                words without belief.
            </p>
            <p>
                They preserved memory instead of land,
            </p>
            <p>
                built monuments instead of tending groves,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                measured fractures and named them order.
            </p>
            <p>
                They spoke of duty, delaying ruin,
            </p>
            <p>
                Invoked honor, adorning robes—

            <p class="group-end">
                Recalling the past only to confirm that its absence.
            </p>
            <p>
                And when the land could yield nothing more, they left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some took what could still be carried—gold, titles, fragments of a world already traded.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Some vanished behind walls; others dissolved quietly into dust.
            </p>
            <p>
                And in the end, only one remained.
            </p>
            <p>
                Not because anything was left to rule.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nor because anything was left to save—
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                But because the land was in him, and he could not let go.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had worn their name, stood among them, sworn their oaths—
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                But while they had only spoken of the land, he had loved it.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had walked beneath its canopy in memories older than himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                He had knelt under the shade and felt its weight.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                He had pressed his hands into the earth and known, without words, that it was sacred.
            </p>
            <p>
                He watched shadow men trade trees for towers,
            </p>
            <p>
                heard whispers become commerce,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                felt promises hollow into silence.
            </p>
            <p>
                Standing atop the last tower, he saw dust—
            </p>
            <p>
                Dust drifting across empty roads,
            </p>
            <p>
                settling on fields no hand had tilled,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                rising from temples where men prayed only to themselves.

            <p>
                The trees had not fallen.
            </p>
            <p>
                They had been given away.
            </p>
            <p>
                First for trade,
            </p>
            <p>
                Then for peace,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Finally, for nothing at all.
            </p>
            <p>
                The forest was not taken, only quietly surrendered,
            </p>
            <p>
                until what remained was too small to name,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                too broken to mourn.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wardens had allowed it.
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                They had profited from it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Now alone, he felt the tower shudder beneath him—
            </p>
            <p>
                Stone, heavy and rootless,
            </p>
            <p class="group-end">
                Sinking slowly into earth.

            <h3>VI. Beneath the Dust</h3>
            <p>
                He had spent his life tending the walls,
            </p>
            <p>
                believing stone could bind the land—

            <p class="group-end">
                But stone binds nothing.

            <p class="group-end">
                The ground had turned to dust.

            <p>
                Past the towers that had become tombs.

                No—only those who felt the land stir within them, even if they did not yet know why.

                They did not ask why they had come.

                For as the roots stretched unseen beneath their feet, something in them stretched too—

            <p class="group-end">
                <b>Something that had never truly left</b>

                He had spent his life tending the walls, believing the walls could hold the land together.

                His crown was living—
            </p>
            <p>
                Woven of roots, rising from earth, binding him not to power,

            <p>
                And when he walked among the trees, they bent toward him,
